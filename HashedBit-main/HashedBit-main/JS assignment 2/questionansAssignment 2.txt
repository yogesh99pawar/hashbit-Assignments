JS Assignment 2

Solve the questions given here -
1. Write code to display from 1 to 100 but just even numbers.
==>
for (let i = 2; i <= 100; i += 2) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. Write a function to calculate which can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers. Use switch inside function.
==>
function calculate(num1, operator, num2) {
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            return num1 + num2;
        case '-':
            return num1 - num2;
        case '*':
            return num1 * num2;
        case '/':
            if (num2 !== 0) {
                return num1 / num2;
            } else {
                return 'Cannot divide by zero!';
            }
        default:
            return 'Invalid operator!';
    }
}


3. You need to write a function findTax() that takes a number type variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow. The tax rates are given below.

if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the entire salary.
If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire salary.
If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary.
If the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary.
==>
function findTax(salary) {
    let taxAmount;
    switch (true) {
        case (salary > 1500000):
            taxAmount = salary * 0.3;
            break;
        case (salary > 1000000):
            taxAmount = salary * 0.2;
            break;
        case (salary > 500000):
            taxAmount = salary * 0.1;
            break;
        default:
            taxAmount = 0;
    }
    return taxAmount;
}

4. Write a function to perform this. You are given two numbers n1 and n2. You need to find the sum of the products of their corresponding digits. So, for a number n1= 6 and n2 = 34, you'll do (6*4)+(0*3) = 24.
==>
function sumOfProducts(n1, n2) {
    let sum = 0;
    while (n1 > 0 || n2 > 0) {
        sum += (n1 % 10) * (n2 % 10);
        n1 = Math.floor(n1 / 10);
        n2 = Math.floor(n2 / 10);
    }
    return sum;
}
